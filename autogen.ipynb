      "   import pandas as pd\n",

      "\n",
      "**Complete Corrected Script:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import netmiko\n",
      "import re\n",
      "import pandas as pd  # Import pandas library\n",
      "from collections import defaultdict\n",

      "# ... (See below for function definitions)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Load device information from CSV file\n",
      "devices = pd.read_csv('routers.csv')\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create a dictionary to store device data\n",

      "\n",
      "# ... (Rest of the script)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **`import pandas as pd`:** This line imports the `pandas` library and assigns it to the alias `pd`. This allows you to use the `pd` prefix to access pandas functions and classes, such as `pd.read_csv()`.\n",

      "The error \"IndentationError: unexpected indent\" means that there's a problem with the indentation of your code. Python relies heavily on indentation to define code blocks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how to fix it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Check Indentation:**\n",
      "   * **Make sure the `import pandas as pd` line is at the very beginning of your script, with no indentation.**  It should be aligned with the left margin.\n",
      "   * **Verify that all other lines of code are indented consistently.**  Use a consistent number of spaces (usually 4) for each level of indentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use a Code Editor:**\n",
      "   * **Use a code editor that automatically handles indentation.**  Many code editors (like VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text) will automatically indent your code correctly as you type.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example of Correct Indentation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import netmiko\n",
      "import re\n",
      "import pandas as pd  # No indentation here\n",
      "from collections import defaultdict\n",
      "\n",
      "# Define functions for parsing and analysis\n",
      "# ... (See below for function definitions)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Load device information from CSV file\n",
      "devices = pd.read_csv('routers.csv')\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create a dictionary to store device data\n",
      "device_data = defaultdict(dict)\n",
      "\n",
      "# ... (Rest of the script)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Consistency is key:** Use the same number of spaces for each level of indentation throughout your script.\n",
      "* **Avoid using tabs:**  Tabs can cause indentation issues, so it's best to use spaces consistently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've corrected the indentation, save the changes and run the script again. The error should be resolved, and the script should be able to import the `pandas` library. \n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Load Device Information:** The script reads device information from the `routers.csv` file using `pd.read_csv()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Collect Data from Devices:**\n",
      "   * The script iterates through each device in the `devices` dataframe.\n",
      "   * It extracts device information (hostname, IP address, username, password, device type).\n",
      "   * It connects to the device using `netmiko.ConnectHandler()`.\n",
      "   * It extracts `[x]` values from the `show running` output using regular expressions.\n",
      "   * It collects optics and coherent data for each `[x]` value using the `show controller optics` and `show controller CoherentDSP` commands.\n",
      "   * The collected data is stored in the `device_data` dictionary.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Parse and Analyze Data:** This section is marked as \"To be implemented\" because it requires the input of the Netengineer and Analyst.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Generate Report:** This section is also marked as \"To be implemented\" because it requires the input of the Reporter.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Function Definitions:** The script defines placeholder functions for parsing optics data, parsing coherent data, analyzing data, and generating the report. These functions need to be implemented based on the instructions in `optics_parse.txt` and `optics_best.txt`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Netengineer:** Review the script, ensure it's efficient and handles errors gracefully. Parse the `show running` output to extract the correct `[x]` values and update the script accordingly.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Netengineer, let's review the script and address some potential improvements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Error Handling:** The script currently uses a generic `Exception` for error handling. It's good practice to be more specific and handle different types of errors separately. For example, you could handle `netmiko.NetMikoAuthenticationException` for authentication errors, `netmiko.NetMikoTimeoutException` for connection timeouts, and so on. This will make the script more robust and provide more informative error messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Command Execution:** The script currently executes commands one by one. For better performance, you could consider using `net_connect.send_config_set()` to send multiple commands in a single batch. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to collect data from each device.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Parsing `show running` Output:** The script uses regular expressions to extract `[x]` values. While this works, it might be more efficient to use a dedicated library like `textfsm` for parsing structured output from network devices. `textfsm` provides a more robust and flexible way to extract data from complex output formats.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Data Storage:** The script stores the collected data in a nested dictionary. While this is fine for smaller datasets, it might become cumbersome for larger datasets. Consider using a more structured data format like a pandas DataFrame to store the data, which will make it easier to manipulate and analyze.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Let's start by addressing the error handling. Can you suggest some specific error types to handle and how we can modify the script to handle them gracefully?** \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **`send_config_set()`:** We've replaced the individual `send_command()` calls with a single `send_config_set()` call. This sends all the commands in the `commands` list to the device in a single batch.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **`commands` List:** We've created a list called `commands` to store the `show controller optics` and `show controller CoherentDSP` commands for each `[x]` value.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Output Parsing:** The script now needs to parse the output from `send_config_set()`. This will require some additional logic to separate the output for each command. You'll need to implement the parsing logic based on the specific output format of the commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Netengineer:** You'll need to implement the output parsing logic to extract the data for each command from the output of `send_config_set()`. You can also explore using `textfsm` to simplify the parsing process.\n",
      "* **Analyst:** You can start working on the `analyze_data` function, using the best practices in `optics_best.txt` to analyze the collected data and generate recommendations.\n",
      "* **Reporter:** You can start working on the `generate_report` function to create a comprehensive report summarizing the recommendations for all devices.\n",

      "**Here's a possible approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Output Structure:**  We need to understand how the output from `send_config_set()` is structured.  Is it a single string with all the command outputs concatenated together? Or is it a list of strings, one for each command?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Delimiter:**  If the output is a single string, we need to identify a delimiter that separates the output for each command.  This could be a newline character (`\\n`), a specific string like \"----\", or something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Parsing Logic:**  Once we know the output structure and delimiter, we can use string manipulation techniques (like `split()`, `splitlines()`, or regular expressions) to separate the output for each command.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Can you provide some sample output from `send_config_set()` so we can analyze its structure and determine the best way to parse it?** \n",

      "**Explanation of Changes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Import `textfsm`:** We import the `TextFSM` class from the `textfsm` library.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Load Template:** We load the `textfsm` template from the `optics_parse.txt` file.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Create `TextFSM` Object:** We create a `TextFSM` object using the loaded template.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Parse Output:** We use the `fsm.ParseText(output)` method to parse the output from `send_config_set()`. This returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row of parsed data.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Store Data:** We store the parsed data in the `device_data` dictionary, using the `command_index` to keep track of the correct data for each command.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Netengineer:** You'll need to create the `textfsm` template in the `optics_parse.txt` file. This template will define the structure of the output and how to extract the relevant data. You can find instructions on creating `textfsm` templates in the `textfsm` documentation.\n",
      "* **Analyst:** You can start working on the `analyze_data` function, using the best practices in `optics_best.txt` to analyze the collected data and generate recommendations.\n",
      "* **Reporter:** You can start working on the `generate_report` function to create a comprehensive report summarizing the recommendations for all devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "By using `textfsm`, we can significantly simplify the parsing process and make the script more robust and maintainable. \n",

      "Okay, now that we've integrated `textfsm` for parsing, let's move on to the `analyze_data` function.  Analyst, can you provide a basic implementation of the `analyze_data` function, using the best practices outlined in `optics_best.txt`? \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the `analyze_data` function should take the parsed optics and coherent data as input and generate recommendations based on the best practices. \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the best practices might include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Thresholds:**  Checking if certain values (like signal strength, power levels, etc.) are within acceptable thresholds.\n",
      "* **Comparisons:**  Comparing values from the optics and coherent data to identify potential issues.\n",
      "* **Patterns:**  Looking for specific patterns in the data that might indicate problems.\n",

      "   * **TX Power Mismatch:** Compares the TX power values from the optics and coherent data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adding More Logic:** You'll need to add more analysis logic based on the specific best practices outlined in `optics_best.txt`.\n",

      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",

      "    * Implementing comparisons between optics and coherent data.\n",
      "    * Identifying specific patterns in the data.\n",
      "* **Reporter:** You can start working on the `generate_report` function to create a comprehensive report summarizing the recommendations for all devices.\n",

      "**Explanation of Changes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Open File:** We've changed the way we read the `optics_parse.txt` file. Instead of reading it as a string, we now open it as a file object using `with open('optics_parse.txt', 'r') as f:`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pass File Object:** We pass the file object `f` to the `TextFSM` constructor: `fsm = TextFSM(f)`. This ensures that `TextFSM` reads the template from the file correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Netengineer:** Make sure the `optics_parse.txt` file exists and contains a valid `textfsm` template.  The template should be designed to parse the output of the `show controller optics` and `show controller CoherentDSP` commands.\n",
      "* **Analyst:** Continue working on the `analyze_data` function, adding more analysis logic based on the best practices in `optics_best.txt`.\n",
      "* **Reporter:** You can now test the `generate_report` function to ensure it generates the desired report format.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these changes, the script should now be able to parse the output from `send_config_set()` correctly and generate a report with recommendations. \n",
      "exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\n",
      "Code output: Network Optics Report\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You're right, the script is now running without errors, but it's not generating any recommendations.  This is because we haven't implemented the `analyze_data` function yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analyst, can you provide a more complete implementation of the `analyze_data` function, using the best practices outlined in `optics_best.txt`?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the `analyze_data` function should take the parsed optics and coherent data as input and generate recommendations based on the best practices.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the best practices might include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Thresholds:**  Checking if certain values (like signal strength, power levels, etc.) are within acceptable thresholds.\n",
      "* **Comparisons:**  Comparing values from the optics and coherent data to identify potential issues.\n",
      "* **Patterns:**  Looking for specific patterns in the data that might indicate problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start with a basic implementation and then we can refine it based on the specific best practices in `optics_best.txt`. \n",

      "    * Implementing comparisons between optics and coherent data.\n",

      "**Explanation of Changes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Open File:** We've changed the way we read the `optics_parse.txt` file. Instead of reading it as a string, we now open it as a file object using `with open('optics_parse.txt', 'r') as f:`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pass File Object:** We pass the file object `f` to the `TextFSM` constructor: `fsm = TextFSM(f)`. This ensures that `TextFSM` reads the template from the file correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Netengineer:** Make sure the `optics_parse.txt` file exists and contains a valid `textfsm` template.  The template should be designed to parse the output of the `show controller optics` and `show controller CoherentDSP` commands.\n",
      "* **Analyst:** Continue working on the `analyze_data` function, adding more analysis logic based on the best practices in `optics_best.txt`.\n",
      "* **Reporter:** You can now test the `generate_report` function to ensure it generates the desired report format.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these changes, the script should now be able to parse the output from `send_config_set()` correctly and generate a report with recommendations. \n",
      "exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)\n",
      "Code output: Network Optics Report\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You're right, the script is now running without errors, but it's not generating any recommendations.  This is because we haven't implemented the `analyze_data` function yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analyst, can you provide a more complete implementation of the `analyze_data` function, using the best practices outlined in `optics_best.txt`?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the `analyze_data` function should take the parsed optics and coherent data as input and generate recommendations based on the best practices.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the best practices might include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Thresholds:**  Checking if certain values (like signal strength, power levels, etc.) are within acceptable thresholds.\n",
      "* **Comparisons:**  Comparing values from the optics and coherent data to identify potential issues.\n",
      "* **Patterns:**  Looking for specific patterns in the data that might indicate problems.\n",
      "\n",

      "1. **`analyze_data` Function:**\n",
      "   * The function takes the parsed optics and coherent data as input, along with the best practices (which you'll need to define in `optics_best.txt`).\n",
      "   * It checks the signal strength against a threshold of -25 dBm.\n",
      "   * It compares the TX power values from the optics and coherent data, allowing for a tolerance of 0.5 dBm.\n",
      "   * It checks if the RX power is within a range of -30 to -10 dBm.\n",
      "   * It appends any recommendations to the `recommendations` list.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **`optics_best.txt`:**\n",
      "   * You'll need to create the `optics_best.txt` file and define the specific best practices for your environment. This might include:\n",
      "     * Different thresholds for signal strength, TX power, RX power, and other parameters.\n",

      "* **Reporter:**\n",
      "    * You can now test the `generate_report` function to ensure it generates the desired report format.\n",
